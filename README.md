# Voter info group project

A web app allowing users to search for their federal congressional representatives across the entire U.S using Google Civic Info API

We used Leaflet and the Mapbox API to render our map, and pulled information from a .geoJSON file found [HERE](https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/) .
The map shows the voting districts of MD & VA. Showing the representatives as well as their financial donation source, the information comes mostly from the Google Civics Information API. 

A visual carousel displays to the user basic info about their congressional reps based on the search input address (supports many address formats).
